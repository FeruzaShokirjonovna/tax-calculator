# **User Experience (UX)**

For this project I didn't make a wireframe in [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/) as in the earlier projects. The reason is the 'Wunder eTax' application will have a command line interface which means that there will not be room for that many creative design choices. Instead I decided to create a logic [Flow Chart](<#flow-chart>) to get a broad understanding of the application flow.

## Flow chart
The flow chart for this application was made with the online service [Lucid App](https://lucid.app/). I tried to keep in on a quite general level but with enough details to get a good understanding of how everything in the application is connected. The flow chart made it more easy when going into the coding phase.
